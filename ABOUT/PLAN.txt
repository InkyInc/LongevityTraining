IDEAS


	- Tell users info 3 times to make sure they understnad everything and they don't regret decision of closing helper too quickly
	
	- Workout journal
		Amount of weight lifted (stronger or not)
		
	
	- Workout cycle
		Do specific workout for X amount of time then change
			bulk < cut < repeat
			
	[Don't see progress going slow]
		Increase weight, lower/ add reps
		
	- Body composition (Muscle vs fat)
		Build muscle, body fat goes down
		
		- Use of electric conductivity testers to testers
		- Don't always trust BMI
			loss 1 pound = gained 1 pound of muscle
			
	- Test yourself every month
		Go as heavy as you can
		
		- Add point system with this idea [Possibility]
		
	- Selfit tracking fitness
	
	- Tape measures
	
	- Need tracker to be easy and fast to users
		No hassle needed and confussion
		
	- APP VERSATILE ***
	
		Make sure app can accomplish a change of program and that you don't need to find a new app or have to develop a whole new workout regiment if you want to edit or change your workout
		
		- Adaptable workout plan
		
	- Date Bodyweight
		- March 23, 2020	180 lbs
			
	- Easy way to see previous lifted weights or even heaviest lifted **
	
	- Keep tracks of sets **		
		- Mark work sets
		- Rest intervals
		- Reps
		- Distance
		- Intensity
		
	- Rest timer (on/off) you choose
		Look into GymBox or Kettlebell Swing Timer
	
	- Welcome Screen
		- Set unit system preference
			(Imperial (LBS))
			(Metric (KGS))
			
	- General navigation (maybe not best idea) [REVIEW: not quite sure what this means honestly]
	
	- Calendar
		
		- Add * on days that you got PR
		- Legend showing which exercice worked out that days
	
	- Allow supersets
		
		Reps < supersets < megasets < cycles
		
		Easter egg if they want to add more superset until 99 superset
			Display easter egg if they reach 99 supersets
	
	- In workout tab
		Bottom of page
			Can see chart to see proportion of body parts used during workout
				[CHECK SCREENSHOT: workout.bottom.jpg]
		Top of page
			Floating elemtn on page doesn't move when scolled (Start button) 
				[CHECK SCREENSHOT: workout.top.jpg]

		[CHECK SCREENSHOT: workout.spreadsheet.jpg]

	- Add offline function for exercices
	
	- Add membership (ADD LATER)
	
	- Challenges for users
	
	- Food Guide
	
	- Scoring System can see how others are doing
	
	- Find only important info
		Add function to everything but only they want to
		
	- Community
		Implement as fast as possible to improve app
			Research Yog, Endomondo, Yogify, Yogatailor
			
		- Leaderboards and badges
	
		- Research block modular smart watches
	
	- Add RPE value for exercises
		RPE = another way to say intensity
